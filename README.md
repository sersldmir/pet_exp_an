# pet_exp_an
Collection of pet Python projects dedicated to exploratory analysis and a little bit of machine learning

 __exp_an__ - Used framingham dataset to explore different correlations between risk factors and coronary heart disease and built a machine learning model (Decison tree classifier, oversampling, undersampling, pipeline)

__life_exp_an__ - Used Life Expectancy Data dataset to analyse different components of one's lifespan (not in terms of one person but a country) and built a machine learning model (random forest regressor, random search cross-validation, grid search cross-validation)

__br_c_an__ - Used Breast Cancer dataset (cleaned and standardized) using t-SNE for 2D visualizing and k-means algorithm for predicting breast cancer relying on 30 parameters
